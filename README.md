# Steganography using AI with python
This project uses AI-powered steganography, where a VGG16 model selects the best image for embedding a secret message. Built with Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and TensorFlow, it ensures secure message hiding and extraction.
# Features

**AI-Based Image Selection:**
* Uses a VGG16 deep learning model to analyse and selects the best image for steganography.

**Secure Message Embedding:**
* Hides text messagws within the image.

**Loseless Extraction:**
* Ensures accurate retrieval of hidden messages.

**Supports Multiple Image Formats:**
* Works with .png,.jpg,and more.

**Python Based Implementation:**
* Built using TenserFlow,OpenCV,and NumPy for efficient processing.
