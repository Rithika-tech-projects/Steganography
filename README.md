# Steganography using AI with python
This project uses AI-powered steganography, where a VGG16 model selects the best image for embedding a secret message. Built with Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and TensorFlow, it ensures secure message hiding and extraction.
# Features

-**AI-Based Image Selection:**
Uses a VGG16 deep learning model to analyse and selects the best image for steganography.

-**Secure Message Embedding:**
Hides text messagws within the image.

-**Loseless Extraction:**
Ensures accurate retrieval of hidden messages.

-**Supports Multiple Image Formats:**
Works with .png,.jpg,and more.

-**Python Based Implementation:**
Built using TenserFlow,OpenCV,and NumPy for efficient processing.

# Requirements
-**Python 3.x** – Required to run Jupyter Notebook
-**Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive coding environment
-**TensorFlow** – AI-based image selection (VGG16 model)
-**OpenCV** – Image processing and manipulation
-**NumPy** – Numerical computations
-**Scikit-Image** – Image similarity analysis
